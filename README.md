# bootstrap-star-rating
A pure jQuery bootstrap star rating.

Why? Because it took me less time to make this than I wasted Googling for one. It doesn't do half stars because I don't care. It doesn't do AJAX because that's on you. It doesn't ship with a CSS file because you already have bootstrap. It doesn't ship with separate icons, because you already have bootstrap. It's the simplest possible star rating system ... it uses the glyphs already in bootstrap! Yay!

More to come, I needed a place to part the WIP.
